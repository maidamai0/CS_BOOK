This is a notice that the official company dress code policy
has changed. All employees are required to follow the new
policy.

We don't want to make a big deal about the policy, which has
been in effect since last September, but it appears that some
people have not been following the new guidelines. Because of
this, we felt it appropriate to introduce the new guidelines
for all employees.

The new policy is available on the company InfoCENTRE. You
will need level 3 security access to view the new company dress 
code  policy. All employees should view this policy TODAY. Be 
careful, though, not to overload the company InfoCENTRE server.
If you have trouble logging in to the secure company InfoCENTRE
site, please call the 800 number for the internal security 
hotline. This number is available on the secure company InfoCENTRE.

You won't be sent home for violating the company dress code policy,
but you will need to work out any issues with your supervisor.
